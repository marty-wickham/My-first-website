# My Very First Webpage

Welcome!

## Link to project: https://martycistudent.github.io/My-first-website/

This is my very first attempt at making a webpage. 
The aim of this project, is to provide a list of various programming languages 
with an identifying logo attached to each title. The logos should also act as links
that will open up the wikipedia page for each language in the list, in a new tab.

To achieve this project, the technologies used in it development include:

- Cloud9: an IDE (Integrated Development Enviroment) to write and test our code
- The command-line-interface (To help us navigate all of our files ad folders)
- Git as a local repository to store all of our work
- Github to store our proects on a remote server and deploy them as live webpages
